Resample QD-345 dataset to expand size from 100 img/class to 1000 img/class.
Revise transforms applied to val/test splits of all datasets.
Add additional "hybrid" method of Fourier-MLP and Fourier-CNN to QD-345 methods.
Add method "Fourier-Transformer" to methods benchmarked on QD-345.
Re-run all ablations and test suite for all datasets.
Add visualizations of failure modes to accompany speculation about reasons for failures.
Run additional experiment on MNIST in which high-frequency noise is added as the test-time corruption. Hypothesis: Fourier-MLP should be minimally affected by HF noise, relative to CNN-based methods.
Calculate a measure of compute used during training to identify potential efficiency advantages
